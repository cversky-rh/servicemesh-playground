= Architecture Choices Service Mesh Topologies
:toc:

Consider architecture choices for the definition of single, multi-tenant, mutlt-cluster service mesh topologies



TBR - but it’s necessary for the Route objects in the istio-system Namespace
TBR - (one thing I learned for sure in this project is that different environments should have dedicated clusters …)

the level of "seperation" can be argued

cluster = env
or
servicemesh = env
or 
namespace = env

each has its own merrits

ie. one does not exclude the other however what is a good practice is

1 servicemesh = Many environemtns .... that is defintely anti-pattern of the use of the mesh

and as I said much earlier in my explanations in my view it is better to think ServiceMesh as part of the APP which would mean 1 cluster => MANY APPS = 1-1 ServiceMesh

what you have now is the "anti-pattern" ie. 1 servicemesh = many environments
