= Securing traffic to external Services with mTLS
:toc:



== Option 1: Secure Traffic to another external service (could be another ServiceMesh not managed by Service Mesh Federation)

=== Option 1a: directly (via `Sidecar`)

==== encrypted

* ServiceEntry and If TLS origination from Envoy:

DestinationRules to ServiceEntry hosts with:
CA Certificate for external service server side certificate (other SM ingress gateway if external service is in a non Federation managed SM)
Client certificate/key pair if the external service (other SM ingress gateway if external service is in a non Federation managed SM) requires client authentication (mTLS). Cert/key pair must be signed by the client CA configured on the external service (other SM ingress gateway if external service is in a non Federation managed SM)

* *WILL NOT IMPLEMENT* ServiceEntry and If TLS origination from application:

Application configuration with:
CA Certificate for external service server side certificate (other SM ingress gateway if external service is in a non Federation managed SM)
Client certificate/key pair if the external service (other SM ingress gateway if external service is in a non Federation managed SM) requires client authentication (mTLS). Cert/key pair must be signed by the client CA configured on the external service (other SM ingress gateway if external service is in a non Federation managed SM)

==== un-encrypted

===== Variation 1: in Service Mesh security `PERMISSIVE`

Connect to External Service with `ServiceEntry` definition

* *Step 1:* Setup link:https://github.com/skoussou/servicemesh-playground/tree/main/Scenario-0-Deploy-In-ServiceMesh#greetings-client-service[Greetings Client Service] within a mesh (`namespace: greetings-client`) but `Greetings Service` is outside (namespace: `greetings-service`)

	oc apply -f smcp-2.1.1-allow_any-auto-mtls.yaml -n <ISTIO_NAMESPACE>

** `ServiceMeshControlPlane` setup
*** `proxy.networking.trafficControl.outbound.policy: ALLOW_ANY`
*** mesh security for mtls is permissive (`spec.security.dataPlane.automtls: true` or `spec.security.dataPlane.mtls: false`)
** `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` include `greetings-client` namespace
** Test it and watch from the KIALI UI the requests flowing from rest-greeting-client to _external service_ established via `PassthroughCluster` 

	watch curl -X GET http://$(oc get route istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}' -n istio-system)/say/goodday-to/Stelios` 

image::./images/1-allow-any-passthroughcluster.png[400,1000]  

** Metrics show the service `rest-greeting-remote.greetings-service.svc.cluster.local:8080` that requests reach (`istio_requests_total{destination_service_name="PassthroughCluster", destination_service="rest-greeting-remote.greetings-service.svc.cluster.local:8080}`)
+
image::./images/2-prometheus-passthroughcluster-greeting-remote-service-metrics.png[400,1000]  


* *Step 2:* Change `ServiceMeshControlPlane` setup to block external services access with `REGISTRY_ONLY` 
** `proxy.networking.trafficControl.outbound.policy: REGISTRY_ONLY`
**  mesh security for mtls is permissive (`spec.security.dataPlane.automtls: true` or `spec.security.dataPlane.mtls: false`)

	oc apply -f smcp-2.1.1-registry_only-auto-mtls.yaml -n <ISTIO_NAMESPACE>
    
** The result is requests to start being directed to `BlackHoleCluster`
+
image::./images/3-REGISTRY_ONLY_Blackhole_Blocking.png[400,1000]

** Create `ServiceEntry` to register external details
      
	echo "kind: ServiceEntry
	apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
	metadata:
	  name: rest-greeting-remote-mesh-ext
	spec:
	  hosts: 
	    - rest-greeting-remote.greetings-service.svc.cluster.local
	  ports:
	    - name: http-8080
	      number: 8080
	      protocol: HTTP
	      targetPort: 8080
	  location: MESH_EXTERNAL
	  resolution: DNS" |oc apply -n greetings-client -f -  

** The requests will now start going through to external `rest-greeting-remote-mesh-ext`
+
image::./images/4-apply-SE-REGISTRY_ONLY.png[400,1000]
            

===== Variation 2: in Service Mesh security `STRICT`

In a Service Mesh where mTLS security is `STRICT` between workloads, connect to External Service with `ServiceEntry` definition and `DestinationRule` to EXCLUDE `details` from the rule

	oc apply -f smcp-2.1.1-registry_only-strict-mtls.yaml -n <ISTIO_NAMESPACE>

* `ServiceMeshControlPlane` setup
** `proxy.networking.trafficControl.outbound.policy: REGISTRY_ONLY`
** mesh security for mtls is strict (`spec.security.dataPlane.mtls: true`)
* `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` include `greetings-client` namespace
* Test it and watch from the KIALI UI the requests flowing from rest-greeting-client to _external service_ established via `PassthroughCluster` 

	watch curl -X GET http://$(oc get route istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}' -n istio-system)/say/goodday-to/Stelios` 


* The result is requests  to external `rest-greeting-remote-mesh-ext` are starting to fail
+
image::./images/5-STRICT-mTLS-Fails-External.png[400,1000]

        
* Create `DestinationRule` to `DISABLE` mTLS for the external service communication
      
echo "apiVersion: "networking.istio.io/v1alpha3"
kind: "DestinationRule"
metadata:
  name: "disable-mtls-rest-greeting-remote-ext"
  namespace: "greetings-client"
spec:
  host: rest-greeting-remote.greetings-service.svc.cluster.local
  trafficPolicy:
    tls:
      mode: DISABLE" |oc apply -n greetings-client -f - 


* The requests will now start again to flow through to external `rest-greeting-remote-mesh-ext`
+

=== Option 1b: via Egress Gateway

==== encrypted

* Better alternative is using link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/service_mesh/v2x/ossm-federation.html[Service Mesh Federation]

* Else ServiceEntry, Gateway, VirtualService, DestinationRule to Egress Gateway 
** If TLS origination from Egress Gateway :

DestinationRule to ServiceEntry hosts with:
CA Certificate for external service server side certificate (other SM ingress gateway if external service is in a non Federation managed SM)
Client certificate/key pair if the external service (other SM ingress gateway if external service is in a non Federation managed SM) requires client authentication (mTLS). Cert/key pair must be signed by the client CA configured on the external service (other SM ingress gateway if external service is in a non Federation managed SM)
 
** If TLS origination from application:

Application configuration with:
CA Certificate for external service server side certificate (other SM ingress gateway if external service is in a non Federation managed SM)
Client certificate/key pair if the external service (other SM ingress gateway if external service is in a non Federation managed SM) requires client authentication (mTLS). Cert/key pair must be signed by the client CA configured on the external service (other SM ingress gateway if external service is in a non Federation managed SM)
 
==== unencrypted

* ServiceEntry, Gateway, VirtualService, DestinationRule to Egress Gateway


== Option 2: To an external service on another Federation managed Service Mesh

=== Option 2a: directly
- encrypted

*TBD SHOWN VIA FEDERATION IMPL*
(Federation uses a pair of Ingress/Egress gateways dedicated to access to imported services)

* unencrypted

WARNING: Impossible by design 

=== Option 2b: via Egress Gateway

- encrypted

*TBD SHOWN VIA FEDERATION IMPL*
ServiceMeshPeer, ExportedServiceSets, ImportedServiceSets
Use encrypted TCP for intermesh traffic between Ingress/Gateways pairs.

- unencrypted


Unencrypted traffic is not possible by design.
