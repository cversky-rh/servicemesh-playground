== PreRequisites

*Pre-requisites:* OSSM Operators have been installed (`scripts/add-operators-subscriptions-sm.sh`)

== Option 1: Secure Traffic to another external service (could be another ServiceMesh not managed by Service Mesh Federation)

[[option1aencrypted]]
=== Option 1a: via `Sidecar`

==== encrypted

[NOTE]
====
In this scenario a `ServiceEntry` for the remote service hostname will be required and for _TLS origination from istio-proxy (envoy)_ a `DestinationRule` to `ServiceEntry` host with:

* `CA Certificate` for verification of the external service server side certificate (other SM ingress gateway if external service is in a non Federation managed SM)
* `Client certificate/key pair` if the external service (other SM ingress gateway if external service is in a non Federation managed SM) requires client authentication (mTLS). Cert/key pair must be signed by the client CA configured on the external service (other SM ingress gateway if external service is in a non Federation managed SM)

[[option1aunencryptedpermissive]]
===== Variation 1: In a Service Mesh with dataplane `mTLS` security `PERMISSIVE`

[NOTE]
====
*Scenario:* In a Service Mesh where mTLS security is `PERMISSIVE` between workloads, first connect to an External Service without mTLS and without the need to register the service then proceed to restrict external access to external services via `REGISTRY_ONLY` setting.
====
First perform the <<PreRequisites,PreRequisites>>

* *Step 1:* Setup a Service Mesh (command below) and add  link:https://github.com/skoussou/servicemesh-playground/tree/main/Scenario-0-Deploy-In-ServiceMesh#greetings-client-service[Greetings Client Service] (namespace: `greetings-client`) within the mesh whilst leaving `Greetings Service` outside (namespace: `greetings-service`) 
** `ServiceMeshControlPlane` setup
*** `proxy.networking.trafficControl.outbound.policy: ALLOW_ANY`
*** mesh security for mtls is permissive (`spec.security.dataPlane.automtls: true` or `spec.security.dataPlane.mtls: false`)
** `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` include `greetings-client` namespace

+

** Metrics show the service `rest-greeting-remote.greetings-service.svc.cluster.local:8080` that requests reach when going via `PassThroughCluster` (`istio_requests_total{destination_service_name="PassthroughCluster", destination_service="rest-greeting-remote.greetings-service.svc.cluster.local:8080}`)
+
image::./images/2-prometheus-passthroughcluster-greeting-remote-service-metrics.png[400,800]  
+
* *Step 2:* Change `ServiceMeshControlPlane` setup to block external services access with `REGISTRY_ONLY` 
** `proxy.networking.trafficControl.outbound.policy: REGISTRY_ONLY`
**  mesh security for mtls is permissive (`spec.security.dataPlane.automtls: true` and `spec.security.dataPlane.mtls: false`)

	oc apply -f smcp-2.1.1-registry_only-auto-mtls.yaml -n <ISTIO_NAMESPACE>

** The result is requests start being directed to a `BlackHoleCluster` and fail Istio does not have in its registry the destination and only registered (`REGISTRY_ONLY`) external destinations are allowed.
+

[[option1aunencryptedstrict]]
===== Variation 2: In a Service Mesh with dataplane `mTLS` security `STRICT`

[NOTE]
====
*Scenario:* In a Service Mesh where mTLS security is `STRICT` between workloads, connect to an External Service with `ServiceEntry` definition and apply a `DestinationRule` to EXCLUDE the external `rest-greeting-remote` service from the policy.
====

First perform the <<PreRequisites,PreRequisites>> and go through <<option1aunencryptedpermissive,Variation 1: In a Service Mesh with security `PERMISSIVE`>>. The previous step and then applying the YAML below will have the following effect:

	oc apply -f smcp-2.1.1-registry_only-strict-mtls.yaml -n <ISTIO_NAMESPACE>

* `ServiceMeshControlPlane` setup
** `proxy.networking.trafficControl.outbound.policy: REGISTRY_ONLY`
** mesh security for mtls is strict (`spec.security.dataPlane.mtls: true`)
* `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` include `greetings-client` namespace
* Test it and watch from the KIALI UI the requests flowing from rest-greeting-client to _external service_ established via `PassthroughCluster` 

	watch curl -X GET http://$(oc get route istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}' -n istio-system)/say/goodday-to/Stelios 

* The result is requests  to external `rest-greeting-remote-mesh-ext` are starting to fail
+
image::./images/5-STRICT-mTLS-Fails-External.png[400,800]

[[option1bencrypted]]
=== Option 1b: via `Istio Egress Gateway`

==== encrypted


[NOTE]
====
In this scenario a `ServiceEntry` (`rest-greeting-remote-mesh-ext`) for the remote service hostname will be required. For _TLS origination_ from `istio-egressgateway` a `VirtualService` (`route-mesh-gw-to-egress-gw`) and `DestinationRule` (``egress-originate-tls-to-rest-greeting-remote) will route to _Egress_ `Gateway` (with `ISTIO_MUTUAL`), then `VirtualService`(`oute-egress-gw-to-ext`), `DestinationRule` (`originate-mtls-for-greeting-remote`) and `Gateway` (`istio-egressgateway`) for that hostname will supply the certificates for `MUTUAL` tls and route tto the registered destination. The final resources can be found in the script link:https://github.com/skoussou/servicemesh-playground/blob/main/Scenario-MTLS-3-SM-Service-To-External-MTLS-Handling/create-greeting-client-1b-encrypted.sh[create-greeting-client-1b-encrypted.sh]. Certificates for the contacted host: 

* `CA Certificate` for verification of the external service server side certificate (other SM ingress gateway if external service is in a non Federation managed SM)
* `Client certificate/key pair` if the external service (other SM ingress gateway if external service is in a non Federation managed SM) requires client authentication (mTLS). Cert/key pair must be signed by the client CA configured on the external service (other SM ingress gateway if external service is in a non Federation managed SM)
