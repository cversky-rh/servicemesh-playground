= Securing traffic to external Services with mTLS
:toc:



== Option 1: Secure Traffic to another external service (could be another ServiceMesh not managed by Service Mesh Federation)

=== Option 1a: directly (via `Sidecar`)

==== encrypted

In this scenario a `ServiceEntry` to the remote service will be required and for _TLS origination from `istio-proxy (envoy)_ `DestinationRule` to `ServiceEntry` hosts with:
a) `CA Certificate` for external service server side certificate (other SM ingress gateway if external service is in a non Federation managed SM)
b) `Client certificate/key pair` if the external service (other SM ingress gateway if external service is in a non Federation managed SM) requires client authentication (mTLS). Cert/key pair must be signed by the client CA configured on the external service (other SM ingress gateway if external service is in a non Federation managed SM)

* *Step 1:* Setup a _Service Side_ Service Mesh (command below) and add link:https://github.com/skoussou/servicemesh-playground/tree/main/Scenario-0-Deploy-In-ServiceMesh#greetings-client-service[Greetings Service] (namespace: `greetings-service`) in the mesh and EXPOSE the service via custom ROUTE with TLS certificate as follows:


----
oc new project client-tenant <1>
oc apply -f smcp-2.1.1-registry_only-strict-mtls.yaml -n client-tenant  (change SMCP name in smcp-2.1.1-registry_only-strict-mtls.yaml to client-tenant) <2>
cd ../scripts/certs 
# Create secrets <3>
oc create -n istio-system-client secret generic greeting-remote-secret --from-file=tls.key=greeting-remote-app.key --from-file=tls.crt=greeting-remote-app.crt --from-file=ca.crt=ca-root.crt <4>
# Create app namespace and deploy app <5>
./create-service-membership.sh istio-system-client client-tenant greetings-service <6>
echo ` ./create-greeting-service-1a.sh <SMCP Namspace> <APP namespace> <REMOTE Service Route HostName> <Route Certificate Name>  <Greeting Cluster Specific Message> `
./create-greeting-service-1a.sh client-tenant greetings-service greeting.remote.com greeting-remote-secret OCP-48-Cluster <7>
----
<1> Create *_client_* Service Mesh Control Plane namespace 
<2> Create a service mesh control plane for the client application
Create Certs (with same CA as client) for `rest-greeting-remote` service see (link:https://github.com/skoussou/servicemesh-playground/blob/main/scripts/certs/README.adoc#create-a-ca-root-certificate-signing-request-tls-certificate-for-hosted-service[Create a CA Root, Certificate Signing Request, TLS Certificate for hosted service])
<3> Create Certs (with same CA as client) for `rest-greeting-remote` service see (link:https://github.com/skoussou/servicemesh-playground/blob/main/scripts/certs/README.adoc#create-a-ca-root-certificate-signing-request-tls-certificate-for-hosted-service[Create a CA Root, Certificate Signing Request, TLS Certificate for hosted service])
<4> Create Secret with Certs in the _Service Mesh Control Plane Namespace_ (see: link:https://github.com/skoussou/servicemesh-playground/blob/main/scripts/certs/README.adoc#create-ocp-secret-to-store-the-certificate-in-istio-system[Create OCP secret to store the certificate ]
<5> Create App namespace and deploy in that the application `rest-greeting-remote` (see: link:link:https://github.com/skoussou/servicemesh-playground/tree/main/Scenario-0-Deploy-In-ServiceMesh#greetings-client-service[Greetings Service])
<6> Add the application to the Service Mesh 
<7> Create the `Gateway`, `VirtualService` and `Route` resources to give access to the application via Service Mesh and over TLS
+
+
* *Step 2:* Setup a _Client Side_ Service Mesh (command below) and add  link:https://github.com/skoussou/servicemesh-playground/tree/main/Scenario-0-Deploy-In-ServiceMesh#greetings-client-service[Greetings Client Service] (namespace: `greetings-client`) within the mesh (configure app to access remote URL of `Greetings Service`)

	oc new project <ISTIO_CLIENT_NAMESPACE>
	oc apply -f mcp-2.1.1-registry_only-strict-mtls.yaml -n <ISTIO_CLIENT_NAMESPACE>  (change SMCP name to service-tenant)

* Access Exposed service at remote `istio-ingressgateway` with TLS certificate (*IMPORTANT:* note it will apply to all services or we need SNI since its the same ROUTE???)
** Certs (same CA as SERVICE)
** Secret with Certs
** `DestinationRule` + `ServiceEntry`

WARNING: Mixup Problems that can occur in the configuration are listed at 
* Outbound : https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/configuration/traffic-management/tls-configuration/#outbound
* Double TLS (TLS origination for a TLS request) : https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/common-problems/network-issues/#double-tls




* *WILL NOT IMPLEMENT* ServiceEntry and If TLS origination from application:

Application configuration with:
CA Certificate for external service server side certificate (other SM ingress gateway if external service is in a non Federation managed SM)
Client certificate/key pair if the external service (other SM ingress gateway if external service is in a non Federation managed SM) requires client authentication (mTLS). Cert/key pair must be signed by the client CA configured on the external service (other SM ingress gateway if external service is in a non Federation managed SM)

==== un-encrypted

===== Variation 1: In a Service Mesh with security `PERMISSIVE`

Connect to External Service with `ServiceEntry` resource definition

* *Step 1:* Setup a Service Mesh (command below) and add  link:https://github.com/skoussou/servicemesh-playground/tree/main/Scenario-0-Deploy-In-ServiceMesh#greetings-client-service[Greetings Client Service] (namespace: `greetings-client`) within the mesh whilst leaving `Greetings Service` outside (namespace: `greetings-service`)

	oc apply -f smcp-2.1.1-allow_any-auto-mtls.yaml -n <ISTIO_NAMESPACE>

** `ServiceMeshControlPlane` setup
*** `proxy.networking.trafficControl.outbound.policy: ALLOW_ANY`
*** mesh security for mtls is permissive (`spec.security.dataPlane.automtls: true` or `spec.security.dataPlane.mtls: false`)
** `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` include `greetings-client` namespace
** Test it 

	watch curl -X GET http://$(oc get route istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}' -n istio-system)/say/goodday-to/Stelios` 

** And watch from the KIALI UI the requests flowing from rest-greeting-client to _external service_ established via `PassthroughCluster` 
+
image::./images/1-allow-any-passthroughcluster.png[400,800]  

** Metrics show the service `rest-greeting-remote.greetings-service.svc.cluster.local:8080` that requests reach when going via `PassThroughCluster` (`istio_requests_total{destination_service_name="PassthroughCluster", destination_service="rest-greeting-remote.greetings-service.svc.cluster.local:8080}`)
+
image::./images/2-prometheus-passthroughcluster-greeting-remote-service-metrics.png[400,800]  

* *Step 2:* Change `ServiceMeshControlPlane` setup to block external services access with `REGISTRY_ONLY` 
** `proxy.networking.trafficControl.outbound.policy: REGISTRY_ONLY`
**  mesh security for mtls is permissive (`spec.security.dataPlane.automtls: true` or `spec.security.dataPlane.mtls: false`)

	oc apply -f smcp-2.1.1-registry_only-auto-mtls.yaml -n <ISTIO_NAMESPACE>
    
** The result is requests to start being directed to `BlackHoleCluster`
+
image::./images/3-REGISTRY_ONLY_Blackhole_Blocking.png[400,800]

** Create `ServiceEntry` to register external details
      
	echo "kind: ServiceEntry
	apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
	metadata:
	  name: rest-greeting-remote-mesh-ext
	spec:
	  hosts: 
	    - rest-greeting-remote.greetings-service.svc.cluster.local
	  ports:
	    - name: http-8080
	      number: 8080
	      protocol: HTTP
	      targetPort: 8080
	  location: MESH_EXTERNAL
	  resolution: DNS" |oc apply -n greetings-client -f -  

** The requests will now start going through to external `rest-greeting-remote-mesh-ext`
+
image::./images/4-apply-SE-REGISTRY_ONLY.png[400,800]   

===== Variation 2: In a Service Mesh with security `STRICT`

In a Service Mesh where mTLS security is `STRICT` between workloads, connect to External Service with `ServiceEntry` definition and `DestinationRule` to EXCLUDE `details` from the rule

	oc apply -f smcp-2.1.1-registry_only-strict-mtls.yaml -n <ISTIO_NAMESPACE>

* `ServiceMeshControlPlane` setup
** `proxy.networking.trafficControl.outbound.policy: REGISTRY_ONLY`
** mesh security for mtls is strict (`spec.security.dataPlane.mtls: true`)
* `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` include `greetings-client` namespace
* Test it and watch from the KIALI UI the requests flowing from rest-greeting-client to _external service_ established via `PassthroughCluster` 

	watch curl -X GET http://$(oc get route istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}' -n istio-system)/say/goodday-to/Stelios` 


* The result is requests  to external `rest-greeting-remote-mesh-ext` are starting to fail
+
image::./images/5-STRICT-mTLS-Fails-External.png[400,800]

        
* Create `DestinationRule` to `DISABLE` mTLS for the external service communication
      
	echo "apiVersion: "networking.istio.io/v1alpha3"
	kind: "DestinationRule"
	metadata:
	  name: "disable-mtls-rest-greeting-remote-ext"
	  namespace: "greetings-client"
	spec:
	  host: rest-greeting-remote.greetings-service.svc.cluster.local
	  trafficPolicy:
	    tls:
	      mode: DISABLE" |oc apply -n greetings-client -f - 


* The requests will now start again to flow through to external `rest-greeting-remote-mesh-ext`
+        
image::./images/6-STRICT-mTLS-DISABLE-FOR-External.png[400,1000]


=== Option 1b: via Egress Gateway

==== encrypted

* Better alternative is using link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/service_mesh/v2x/ossm-federation.html[Service Mesh Federation]

* Else ServiceEntry, Gateway, VirtualService, DestinationRule to Egress Gateway 
** If TLS origination from Egress Gateway :

DestinationRule to ServiceEntry hosts with:
CA Certificate for external service server side certificate (other SM ingress gateway if external service is in a non Federation managed SM)
Client certificate/key pair if the external service (other SM ingress gateway if external service is in a non Federation managed SM) requires client authentication (mTLS). Cert/key pair must be signed by the client CA configured on the external service (other SM ingress gateway if external service is in a non Federation managed SM)
 
** If TLS origination from application:

Application configuration with:
CA Certificate for external service server side certificate (other SM ingress gateway if external service is in a non Federation managed SM)
Client certificate/key pair if the external service (other SM ingress gateway if external service is in a non Federation managed SM) requires client authentication (mTLS). Cert/key pair must be signed by the client CA configured on the external service (other SM ingress gateway if external service is in a non Federation managed SM)
 
==== unencrypted

* ServiceEntry, Gateway, VirtualService, DestinationRule to Egress Gateway


== Option 2: To an external service on another Federation managed Service Mesh

=== Option 2a: directly
- encrypted

*TBD SHOWN VIA FEDERATION IMPL*
(Federation uses a pair of Ingress/Egress gateways dedicated to access to imported services)

* unencrypted

WARNING: Impossible by design 

=== Option 2b: via Egress Gateway

- encrypted

*TBD SHOWN VIA FEDERATION IMPL*
ServiceMeshPeer, ExportedServiceSets, ImportedServiceSets
Use encrypted TCP for intermesh traffic between Ingress/Gateways pairs.

- unencrypted


Unencrypted traffic is not possible by design.



== Create Certificates


=== Create CA, CSR and Service Side Certificates

1. Create a CA Root, Certificate Signing Request, TLS Certificate for hosted service

* These instructions are for self-signed certificates however PKI and CA based certs can & should be used in real environemtns

* Update/Copy & Modify (based on -self-signed- CA org information) `scripts/certs/app-default.conf`

	cd scripts/certs
	vim app-default.conf

* Create CA (self-signed)

	create-ca-root-certs-keys.sh
	
* Create CSR, Certificate for the app (self-signed)

	create-app-csr-certs-keys.sh 	  <APPLICATION-CERTIFICATE-INFO> <Certificate-Names-Prefix>
	eg. create-app-csr-certs-keys.sh app-default.conf greeting-remote

2. Create secret with certificate in `istio-system`

	oc create -n istio-system secret generic greeting-remote-secret \
	--from-file=tls.key=greeting-remote-app.key \
	--from-file=tls.crt=greeting-remote-app.crt \
	--from-file=ca.crt=ca-root.crt \
	-n istio-system

4. Create/Update `Route` with passthrough TLS termination and https target port (change `name`, `namespace`,`host` according to your configurations if exposing a different service)

  ** *NOTE:* Route can have one of the following configurations. We select passthrough so we can present a certificate at the `istio-ingressgateway` for the specific service host

  *** *passthrough:* - the TLS handshake will be terminated at the next point (service POD) which is the `istio-ingressgateway` when the `Gateway` Object is set with a `credential` name (see below)
  *** *Edge:* - present a certificate (default of the `ingresscontroller` - self-signed)
  *** *ReEncrypt:* will present a certificate set by you on the route itself or the self-signed, and initiate a new TLS origination from the `ingresscontroller` to the destination service / pod (ie. `istio-ingressgateway` for Service Mesh)

	echo "kind: Route
	apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
	metadata:
	  name: istio-ingressgateway
	  namespace: istio-system
	spec:
	  to:
	    kind: Service
	    name: istio-ingressgateway
	    weight: 100
	  port:
	    targetPort: https
	  tls:
	    termination: passthrough
	  wildcardPolicy: None" | oc apply -n istio-system -f -

5. Create/Update `Gateway` Configuration for `SIMPLE` TLS (change `name`, `credentialName`,`host` according to your configurations if exposing a different service)

	echo "apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
	kind: Gateway
	metadata:
	  name: rest-greeting-remote-gateway
	spec:
	  selector:
	    istio: ingressgateway
	  servers:
	  - port:
	      number: 8443
	      name: https
	      protocol: HTTPS
	    tls:
	      credentialName: greeting-remote-secret
	      mode: SIMPLE	      
	    hosts:
	    - greeting.remote.com" | oc apply -n greetings-service -f -

ABOVE JUST FOR TESTING AS SOON AS OK CHANGE TO MUTUAL
