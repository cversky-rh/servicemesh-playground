= Testing OSSM Edge Configurations
:toc:

The following showcase how behavior is affected by Mesh `spec.proxy.networking.trafficControl.policy` settings of `ALLOW_ANY` and `REGISTRY_ONLY` and also how you can enable incoming requests to the mesh from a non-mesh but same OCP cluster namespace

== Demo `Outgoing` Mesh Access with REGISTRY_ONLY & mTLS

* Follow instructions in link:https://github.com/skoussou/servicemesh-playground/tree/main/Scenario-MTLS-3-SM-Service-To-External-MTLS-Handling#option-1a-directly-via-sidecar[Option 1a: directly (via Sidecar)]
* After the above works successfully. `oc delete ServiceEntry rest-greeting-remote-mesh-ext -n  greetings-client` will result in a failure as without `ServiceEntry` the mesh will not allow external traffic when  policy: REGISTRY_ONLY

== Demo `Outgoing` Mesh Access with ALLOW_ANY (non-mTLS)

[NOTE]

First execute the above as it is required also for this demo)

* With the above demo working as expected execute link:https://github.com/skoussou/servicemesh-playground/blob/main/Scenario-MTLS-3-SM-Service-To-External-MTLS-Handling/test-greeting-client-allow-any.sh[`test-greeting-client-allow-any.sh`] to setup access to external service without `ServiceEntry` due to `ALLOW_ANY` mesh setting of `spec.proxy.networking.trafficControl.policy`
