:toc:

Gather various deployment setups for the observability stack handling different needs

= Basic Setup

Using Jaeger in Service Mesh(Istio)				https://tracing.cloudnative101.dev/docs/ocp-istio-java.html#_understanding_jaeger_service_mesh_kiali
Distributed Tracing Infrastructure with Jaeger on Kubernetes	https://medium.com/@masroor.hasan/tracing-infrastructure-with-jaeger-on-kubernetes-6800132a677

= Tracing

== Production Setup 

* External Jaeger (agent deployment sidecar/stateful set)
** Jaeger Client https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-java/blob/master/jaeger-core/README.md
