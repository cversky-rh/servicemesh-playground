= How to Approach Sizing of the `SMCP` 
:toc:

Would like to seek help regarding Service Mesh Control Plane Sizing.

== Documentation on Starting with Control Plane Sizing

. Any document / guide regarding the sizing of the service mesh control plane?
. Is there a recommended sizing for the control plane components (grafana/ kiali /prometheus)?

Reference

* https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/deployment/performance-and-scalability/
* https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/service_mesh/v2x/ossm-performance-scalability.html#additional-latency

== Perf Testing & Tuning

. Is there a recommended CPU/RAM ratio to the number of microservices in service mesh?
. Is there a recommended CPU/RAM ratio to the number of requests in service mesh?

=== Control Plane
*TODO* Explore the causes of CPU/RAM resources from the control plane components

- istiod

[NOTE]
====
 need to consider what happens to it when there are 1000s of
 
 * configs to apply
 * microservices to apply it to
 * topology of datapalne

- ingressgateway

- egressgateway

- tracing stack

- metric stack



=== Data  Plane


*TODO* Explore the causes of CPU/RAM resources from the control data components

- istio-proxy 

[NOTE]
====
 need to consider what happens to it when there are 1000s of
 
 * requests (what prodocol type, tls/non-tls, size of request)
 * configs applied (MEM)
